DESCRIPTION
    The module is designed as an alternative to the native search OTRS. It
    serves to generate search queries from OTRS to the full-text search
    engine Sphinx through module Sphinx::Search. Using this module requires
    some changes in the OTRS controller: Modules/AgentTikketsearh.pm. These
    changes relate mainly to the processing of input data. For instance
    queue names are converted to their IDs. All this is true if you do not
    want something exotic. Config example of the Sphinx and important parts
    of the controller are located in the directory "samples/".
